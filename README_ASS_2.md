Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

The program first prompts the user to enter an integer.
Then, it checks whether the number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%) and an if-else statement.
If the number is divisible by 2, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.



Task 2: Calculate the Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

The program uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 50.
During each iteration, it adds the current number to a running total.
After the loop completes, it prints the final sum of the numbers from 1 to 50.

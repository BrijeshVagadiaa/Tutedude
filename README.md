Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

The code first prompts the user to enter two numbers (Number1 and Number2).
It stores these two numbers in a list called Number. Then, it performs and calculates the following operations using the two numbers:

Addition: Calculates the sum of Number1 and Number2.
Subtraction: Subtracts Number2 from Number1.
Multiplication: Multiplies Number1 by Number2.
Division: Divides Number1 by Number2 (floating-point division).

Finally, it prints out the results of these operations clearly labeled.




Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

The program prompts the user to input their first name and last name.

After receiving both inputs, it prints a greeting message that says:
"Hello, [First Name] [Last Name]! Welcome to the Python program"
